# go-httpud

## Description

HTTPud is a shameless Go clone of the superb [HTTPie](https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie)
by Jakub Roztoƒçil, but with only a fraction of the features. Intended for 
cases where a Python/pip installation of HTTPie isn't possible.

## Installation

go-httpud's `http` command can be installed with the regular `go get` command:

    go get github.com/johnsto/go-httpud/cmd/http

## Usage

Use the `http` command, e.g.:

    http get yourapihere.com
